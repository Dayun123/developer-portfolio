# Developer Portfolio

A collection of projects, from the extremely simple to the fairly complex, that showcase my skills as a web developer.

## Simple Accordion

[REPO](https://github.com/Dayun123/simple-accordion)

A simple implementation of a JavaScript accordion. There is no real styling or attempt to make this cross-browser compatible, I just wanted to practice toggling content based on a button push.

A live demo can be found here: [Accordion Demo](https://daniel-schroeder-dev.github.io/simple-accordion/)

## Lazy Loading

[REPO](https://github.com/Dayun123/lazy-loading)

The project at the end of Chris Ferndinandi's [DOM Injection and Traversal](https://vanillajsguides.com/dom-injection-and-traversal/) was to implement lazy loading of images. This is my attempt after reading that short guide. It doesn't follow his example to the letter, it was more the overall concept that I was trying to get right.

A live demo can be found here: [Lazy Loading Demo](https://lazy-loading-make-things-clone.herokuapp.com/)

## Web Storage

[REPO](https://github.com/Dayun123/web-storage)

A simple example which demonstrates a way to use the Web Storage API to save some user-based styles between page visits. Any styles you pick below should be saved in local storage and will be reloaded whenever you refresh or revisit the page. Based on [MDN Web Storage Example](https://mdn.github.io/dom-examples/web-storage/)

## Persist Form Values

[REPO](https://github.com/daniel-schroeder-dev/persist-form-values)

A simple example that shows how the Web Storage API can be used to persist user data between page loads. Based on the final project in Chris Ferdinandi's [Browser Storage](https://vanillajsguides.com/browser-storage/).
