# Developer Portfolio

A collection of projects, from the extremely simple to the fairly complex, that showcase my skills as a web developer.

## Simple Accordion

[REPO](https://github.com/Dayun123/simple-accordion)

A simple implementation of a JavaScript accordion. There is no real styling or attempt to make this cross-browser compatible, I just wanted to practice toggling content based on a button push.

A live demo can be found here: [Accordion Demo](https://jsfiddle.net/Dayun123/s3eow4pu/)
